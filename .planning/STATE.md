## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Node.js 22 + TypeScript for Azure Functions (shared runtime with SPFx frontend)
- [Roadmap]: Azure SQL is single source of truth; Exchange calendars are write-through display layer
- [Roadmap]: React 17.0.1 exact pin required (React 18 breaks SPFx 1.22)
- [Roadmap]: Fluent UI v8 only (v9 has known rendering issues in SPFx context)
- [Phase 01]: Route uses 'backoffice/health' instead of 'admin/health' - Azure Functions reserves /admin prefix
- [Phase 01]: Azure Functions v4 Node.js requires explicit imports of function modules in entry point (no auto-discovery)
- [Phase 01]: Role badge placed in sidebar footer, not header -- keeps header clean
- [Phase 01]: AuthContext provides fallback Employee role user when API call fails -- shell still renders
- [Phase 01]: BottomTabBar MAX_VISIBLE_TABS = 4 (top 3 items + More)
- [Phase 01]: ErrorBoundary uses Fluent UI MessageBar for inline error, not modal
- [Phase 01]: No code changes needed during integration verification -- both projects built clean on first attempt

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Exchange equipment mailbox licensing must be confirmed before Phase 5 (M365 Calendar Integration)
- @pnp/spfx-controls-react 3.23.0 compatibility with SPFx 1.22 Heft build needs validation in Phase 1
